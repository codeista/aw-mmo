# Development Workflow & Next Steps

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2)

### 1. **Multiple Units System**
```typescript
// Design Decision Required:
// Option A: Fixed 3 units per player
// Option B: Purchase units with resources
// Option C: Reinforcement waves

// @game-design-agent: Which option best serves gameplay?
// @architecture-agent: How to structure unit management?
```

### 2. **Unit Types (Rock-Paper-Scissors)**
```
Infantry → Strong vs Artillery
Tank → Strong vs Infantry  
Artillery → Strong vs Tank

// Each type needs:
- Unique movement range
- Attack patterns
- Visual distinction
- Counter-play options
```

### 3. **Enhanced Combat Mechanics**
- Counter-attacks when attacked
- Flanking bonuses
- Unit facing direction
- Partial damage on retreat

## 📋 Structured Development Process

### For Each New Feature:

#### 1. **Design Phase** (1-2 days)
```markdown
## Feature: [Name]
### Problem it Solves:
### Player Experience:
### Technical Approach:
### Success Metrics:
```

#### 2. **Prototype Phase** (2-3 days)
- Build minimal version
- Test with mock data
- Validate fun factor
- Get player feedback

#### 3. **Implementation Phase** (3-5 days)
- Backend logic first
- Frontend display second
- Tests alongside code
- Documentation as you go

#### 4. **Polish Phase** (1-2 days)
- Performance optimization
- Visual feedback
- Error handling
- Edge cases

## 🔄 Iteration Cycles

### Sprint Structure (2 weeks)
- Week 1: Design + Prototype
- Week 2: Implementation + Polish
- Always ship playable builds

### Feature Flags
```typescript
const FEATURES = {
  MULTIPLE_UNITS: false,
  UNIT_TYPES: false,
  COUNTER_ATTACKS: false,
  FOG_OF_WAR: false,
};

// Gradual rollout
if (FEATURES.MULTIPLE_UNITS) {
  // New system
} else {
  // Current system
}
```

## 🏗️ Technical Debt Prevention

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows architecture patterns
- [ ] Has test coverage > 80%
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance impact measured
- [ ] Feature flag if experimental

### Refactoring Windows
- After each major feature
- When patterns emerge
- Before complexity increases
- When tests become fragile

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Player Engagement
- Average session: 15-30 min
- Matches completed: > 80%
- Return rate: > 40% daily
- Rage quits: < 5%

### Technical Health
- Build time: < 30s
- Test suite: < 2 min
- Bundle size: < 300KB
- Lighthouse score: > 90

## 🤝 Collaboration Model

### When to Use Agents:
```
@architecture-agent: System design changes
@game-design-agent: New features/mechanics  
@code-quality-agent: PR reviews
@security-agent: Multiplayer features
@performance-agent: Before major releases
```

### Decision Making:
1. Propose with agent review
2. Prototype if uncertain
3. Measure impact
4. Iterate based on data

## 🎮 Next Session Goals

1. **Design multiple units system**
   - How many units?
   - Spawn mechanics?
   - Death consequences?

2. **Prototype unit types**
   - Stats for each type
   - Visual design
   - Balance testing

3. **Plan enhanced combat**
   - Counter-attack rules
   - Damage formulas
   - Animation system
