# Development Workflow & Quality Control Process

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Protocol

All changes to the Insect Colony Wars codebase must follow this workflow to ensure quality, consistency, and alignment with the game's design vision.

### 1. Pre-Development Checklist ‚úÖ

Before implementing any feature or fix:

- [ ] **Consult Design Documents**: Review GAME_FLOW.md, README.md, and existing documentation
- [ ] **Check Architecture**: Ensure changes align with current system architecture
- [ ] **Impact Analysis**: Identify all components that will be affected
- [ ] **User Approval**: Get explicit approval for:
  - New features
  - Major refactors
  - UI/UX changes
  - Game mechanics modifications
  - Performance optimizations that change behavior

### 2. Development Process üîß

#### A. Code Implementation
1. Create a new branch for the feature/fix
2. Write clean, documented code following existing patterns
3. Add appropriate TypeScript types
4. Include error handling

#### B. Testing Requirements
- [ ] **TypeScript Compilation**: `npx tsc --noEmit` must pass
- [ ] **Manual Testing**: Test all affected features in-game
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- [ ] **Performance**: Verify no performance degradation

### 3. Multi-Agent Review Process ü§ñ

Each change must be reviewed by specialized agents:

#### A. System Architect Review
- Code structure and patterns
- Integration with existing systems
- Scalability considerations
- Database schema impacts

#### B. Quality Assurance Review
- Functionality testing
- Bug identification
- Edge case analysis
- User experience flow

#### C. Game Designer Review
- Game balance impacts
- Player experience
- Feature alignment with game vision
- Fun factor assessment

#### D. Performance Analyst Review
- Rendering performance
- Memory usage
- Network efficiency (for multiplayer)
- Optimization opportunities

### 4. Documentation Requirements üìö

All changes must include:
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic
- [ ] **README Updates**: If adding new features
- [ ] **GAME_FLOW Updates**: If changing game mechanics
- [ ] **Commit Messages**: Clear, descriptive messages

### 5. Approval Gates üö¶

#### Minor Changes (Bug fixes, small UI tweaks)
1. Developer implements
2. QA agent reviews
3. Auto-merge if tests pass

#### Medium Changes (New features, refactors)
1. Developer proposes change
2. System Architect reviews design
3. User approves approach
4. Implementation
5. Full agent review
6. User final approval

#### Major Changes (Core mechanics, architecture)
1. Written proposal with:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Impact analysis
   - Alternative approaches
2. User approval of proposal
3. Prototype/POC if needed
4. Full implementation
5. Comprehensive agent review
6. User testing and final approval

### 6. Post-Implementation Checklist ‚úì

After changes are approved:
- [ ] **Update Documentation**: All relevant docs updated
- [ ] **Create Tests**: Add test cases for new functionality
- [ ] **Performance Baseline**: Record performance metrics
- [ ] **Deployment Notes**: Document any special deployment steps
