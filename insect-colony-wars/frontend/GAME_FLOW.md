# Insect Colony Wars - Game Flow Guide

## üéÆ Game Overview
A roguelike RTS where you control an ant colony. Your goal: produce a young queen that matures and flies away to safety before your colony dies.

## üêú Game Start Flow

### 1. Initial Spawn (Automatic)
- **What happens**: Game auto-spawns your first queen on the surface
- **Location**: Random position on surface (z = 0)
- **Resources**: Colony starts with 20 queen jelly
- **View**: Game starts in underground view

### 2. Queen Digs Burrow (5 seconds)
- **Action**: Queen automatically starts digging when spawned
- **Visual**: Queen shows "Building" status
- **Duration**: 5 seconds
- **Result**: Creates:
  - Surface entrance at z = -1 (tunnel entrance)
  - Burrow chamber at z = -10 (deep underground)
  - Vertical tunnel connecting them

### 3. Queen Moves Underground
- **Location**: Queen moves to z = -10 (burrow chamber)
- **Action**: Queen lays first egg automatically
- **Cost**: 0.5 queen jelly (now at 19.5)
- **Visual**: Egg appears in burrow chamber
- **Auto-Discovery**: 3 nearby surface resources are discovered

### 4. Automated Colony Start
- **First Egg**: Automatically transforms to worker after 2 seconds
- **Worker Behavior**: Automatically assigned to gather resources
- **Resource Discovery**: Colony starts with 3 discovered food resources nearby

## üéØ Basic Actions

### Automated Colony Building
The colony AI automatically builds to this composition:
1. **2 Workers** - For resource gathering
2. **1 Scout** - For exploration and threat detection
3. **2 Soldiers** - For defense and hunting
4. **1 Royal Worker** - For jelly production (after basics)

### Manual Control (Optional)
1. **Select any ant** to see available actions
2. **Override AI** by assigning specific tasks
3. **Build chambers** manually with workers

### Resource Gathering Flow
**Automated**:
- Workers automatically gather from discovered resources
- Scouts discover new resources while exploring
- Workers navigate through burrows automatically

**Manual**:
1. Select worker ant
2. Click "üçé Gather Food" button
3. Worker automatically:
   - Moves to burrow chamber (z = -10)
   - Navigates to entrance (z = -1)
   - Exits to surface (z = 0)
   - Gathers from nearest resource
   - Returns through same path
