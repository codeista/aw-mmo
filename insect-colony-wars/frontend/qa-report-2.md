# QA Report - Code Quality Analysis

## Executive Summary
Found and fixed 2 critical bugs that would cause runtime errors. Identified several code quality issues that should be addressed.

## ✅ Fixed Critical Issues

### 1. Duplicate 'scout' Case Statements
- **Status**: FIXED
- **Issue**: Three 'scout' cases in switch statements (lines 3798, 5077, 5095)
- **Impact**: Unreachable code, potential bugs
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate case statement

### 2. Resource Clear Bug
- **Status**: FIXED  
- **Issue**: Resources were being set then immediately cleared
- **Impact**: All resource data was being deleted after adding
- **Fix**: Removed redundant clear/set operations

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **Memory Leaks**
   - Multiple setInterval() without cleanup
   - No clearInterval() when component unmounts
   - Will cause performance degradation over time

### Medium Priority  
2. **Excessive Console Logging**
   - 78 console.log in main.ts
   - 120 console.log in mock service
   - Should use debug flag or remove for production

3. **TypeScript Errors**
   - 22 remaining errors (mostly unused variables)
   - Should be cleaned up for better maintainability

### Low Priority
4. **Code Duplication**
   - Similar logic repeated in multiple places
   - Could be refactored into shared functions

## Performance Concerns

1. **LocalStorage Saves**
   - Saving on every action
   - Should be throttled/debounced

2. **Update Loops**
   - Multiple forEach in update cycles
   - Could be optimized with better data structures

3. **No Debouncing**
   - UI updates on every change
   - Should batch updates

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ Fix duplicate scout cases (DONE)
2. ✅ Fix resource clear bug (DONE)
3. Add cleanup for intervals
4. Add debug flag for console logs

### Future Improvements:
1. Implement proper state management
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Refactor duplicate code
4. Add unit tests

## Test Scenarios to Verify

1. **Resource Discovery**
   - Spawn scout
   - Discover resource
   - Verify resource persists in UI

2. **Command Queue**
   - Add multiple gather commands
   - Verify no duplicate execution
   - Test repeat functionality

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Run game for 10+ minutes
   - Monitor browser memory usage
   - Check for increasing memory

## Code Metrics

- **File Size**: main.ts is 5200+ lines (too large)
- **Complexity**: Multiple 100+ line functions
- **Console Logs**: 198 total (should be < 10)
- **TypeScript Errors**: 22 (should be 0)

## Conclusion

The critical bugs have been fixed, making the game stable for testing. However, there are several code quality issues that should be addressed for a production-ready application. The memory leak issues are the most important to fix next.
